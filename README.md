# GPU-Accelerated Sentiment Analysis Engine
---

## Project Goal
We have developed a sentiment engine using **12 CUDA kernels** to predict 1–5 star ratings from 7M Yelp reviews. By migrating the inference pipeline to a native CUDA C++ extension with a **custom register-tiled GEMM**, we achieve significant speedups and full hardware control over standard PyTorch.

---

## Development Roadmap
*   **Environment & Data**: Initialized CUDA v13.2 environment on RTX 5060; tokenized 7M Yelp reviews into a binary `.npz` format for fast GPU ingestion.
*   **Baseline Model**: Developed the `ControlledModel` in PyTorch and generated high-accuracy weights (`.pth`) to serve as the ground-truth for CUDA migration.
*   **C++ Extension**: Built the PyBind11 bridge (`custom_cuda_ops`) to allow low-latency tensor passing between the Python host and CUDA device.
*   **Kernel Development**: Implemented **12 hand-written CUDA kernels** for the full NLP pipeline (Embeddings, Pooling, BatchNorm, Softmax, etc.).
*   **High-Perf Optimizations**: Replaced standard libraries with a **Custom Tiled GEMM** and implemented **Kernel Fusion** to eliminate memory round-trips.
*   **System Refactor**: Successfully deployed a **Unity Build** system and finalized the production architecture (`custom_pipeline` logic).

## Benchmarking Matrix Multiplication
The project includes a specialized tool to compare our hand-optimized **Register-Tiled GEMM (K10)** against **NVIDIA cuBLAS**.

**Run the benchmark:**
```powershell
python tests/benchmark_gemm.py
```
This script sweeps across different matrix sizes (Small, Medium, Large) and reports:
- **Latency (ms)**: Total execution time.
- **TFLOPS**: Effective floating-point throughput.
- **Winner**: Identifies which implementation is faster for each workload.

### The Recommended Workflow
```
Write / modify a kernel
        ↓
python tests/run_all_tests.py   ← Did THIS kernel get the math right?
        ↓ PASS
Ship it
```
