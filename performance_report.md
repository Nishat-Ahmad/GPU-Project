# Performance Report: Modular CUDA Pipeline

This document consolidates the benchmarking and profiling results for the RTX 5060 deployment of the modular CUDA pipeline.

## 1. Overall Pipeline Performance
*Measured via `tests/compare_full_model.py`.*

| Metric | Baseline (PyTorch CUDA) | Custom CUDA Pipeline | Speedup |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Forward Pass (Batch: 2048) | 5.77 ms | 3.62 ms | **1.59x** |
| Memory Footprint | ~14.88 MB | ~1.10 MB | **13.5x** |

> [!NOTE]
> **Why is the Custom Pipeline faster?**
> The **1.59x speedup** is achieved through several low-level hardware optimizations that are often absent in generalized frameworks:
> 1.  **Kernel Fusion (K16, K17)**: Operations like *Bias + Activation* and *Softmax (Max + Sum + Norm)* are fused into single-pass grid launches. This reduces the number of DRAM round-trips and minimizes the kernel dispatch overhead on the CPU.
> 2.  **Memory Bandwidth Saturation**: By utilizing **`float4` vectorized loads**, we read 128 bits of data per instruction. This more effectively saturates the High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) of the RTX 5060 compared to standard 32-bit element-wise access.
> 3.  **Tiled Register Management (K10)**: Our custom GEMM implementation uses a **4x4 register-tiling** strategy and shared memory buffers to minimize Global Memory access.
> 4.  **Warp-Level Primitives**: We utilize high-speed **`__shfl_down_sync`** instructions for parallel reductions in BatchNorm and Softmax, bypassing slower shared-memory-based reduction patterns.

### 1.1 C++ Standalone Baseline (Historical)
*This benchmark compared the full CUDA pipeline against a single-threaded C++ CPU implementation (Batch: 128) prior to code cleanup.*

**How this test was conducted:**
- **Standalone C++ Environment**: The test was written in pure C++ and CUDA, completely bypassing the Python interpreter and PyTorch overhead to measure raw kernel execution speed.
- **Random Data Parity**: The same set of random input tokens and lengths was generated and processed by both the CPU and GPU paths to ensure perfect mathematical alignment.
- **Warm-up Phase**: To eliminate "Cold Start" noise (CUDA context initialization and kernel loading), the GPU pipeline was executed 3 times as a warm-up before the final timed run.
- **Hardware-Level Timing**: Used high-precision `cudaEvent_t` timers to measure the GPU duration and standard C++ `<chrono>` for the CPU.

| Execution | Time |
| :--- | :--- |
| CPU Reference (Single-threaded C++) | 75.92 ms |
| GPU Custom Pipeline (12 CUDA Kernels) | **0.136 ms** |
| **Speedup** | **558x** |

## 2. Individual Kernel Deep Dive
*Measured via `tests/run_all_tests.py` and NVIDIA `ncu`.*

| Kernel | Torch Benchmark | Hardware Latency (`ncu`) | Bandwidth Utilization | Occupancy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **K1: Pad/Truncate** | 10.03 µs | 5.12 µs | 55.50 GB/s | 74.29% |
| **K2: Embedding** | 340.44 µs | 212.15 µs | 12.10 GB/s | 85.12% |
| **K3: Positional Encoding** | 577.65 µs | 402.10 µs | 45.20 GB/s | 68.40% |
| **K4: Weighted Pooling** | 1114.93 µs | 850.32 µs | 32.15 GB/s | 62.15% |
| **K16: Fused Bias+ReLU** | 698.64 µs | 412.15 µs | 55.50 GB/s | 85.12% |
| **K7-9: Full BatchNorm** | 37.22 µs | 18.50 µs | 65.40 GB/s | 72.10% |
| **K10: GEMM Tiled** | 28.37 µs | 14.12 µs | 145.2 GB/s | 92.15% |
| **K11: Logit Projection** | 12.65 µs | 6.10 µs | 95.20 GB/s | 96.40% |
| **K17: Fused Softmax** | 10.60 µs | 8.12 µs | 112.4 GB/s | 98.40% |
| **K15: Argmax** | 10.75 µs | 5.25 µs | 89.40 GB/s | 95.2% |

### **Metric Glossary**
- **Torch Benchmark**: The time PyTorch takes to execute an equivalent operation (includes Python-to-CUDA dispatch overhead).
- **Hardware Latency (ncu)**: The raw execution time on the GPU silicon, excluding all host-side overhead.
- **Bandwidth Utilization**: How much of the GPU's theoretical memory throughput is being used. Higher is better for memory-bound kernels (like Embedding).
- **Occupancy**: The ratio of active warps to the maximum supported warps on the SM. Higher occupancy helps "hide" memory latency.

## 4. GEMM: cuBLAS (Tensor Cores) vs. Custom "Pro" Kernel
*Measured via `scripts/benchmark_gemm.py` across 100 iterations. The custom kernel utilizes 4x4 Register Tiling.*

| Matrix Size | Metric | cuBLAS (TF32) | Custom (Pro) | Performance Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **128 x 128** | Latency | 0.1999 ms | 0.1419 ms | **Custom Kernel** is 1.41x faster |
| | TFLOPS | 0.0210 | 0.0296 | |
| **512 x 512** | Latency | 0.0833 ms | 0.0717 ms | **Custom Kernel** is 1.16x faster |
| | TFLOPS | 3.2241 | 3.7415 | |
| **2048 x 2048**| Latency | 2.1043 ms | 7.9794 ms | **cuBLAS** is 3.79x faster |
| | TFLOPS | 8.1641 | 2.1530 | |
| **2048 x 64 x 128** | Latency | 0.0688 ms | 0.0494 ms | **Custom (FC1)** is 1.39x faster |
| | TFLOPS | 0.4874 | 0.6799 | |
| **2048 x 128 x 5** | Latency | 0.0755 ms | 0.0480 ms | **Custom (FC2)** is 1.57x faster |
| | TFLOPS | 0.0347 | 0.0546 | |

> [!TIP]
> **Production Choice:** While cuBLAS was evaluated, our **Custom "Pro" Kernel (K10) was selected for the final pipeline**. It out-performs cuBLAS on our actual production matrix dimensions—achieving a **1.39x speedup** on the hidden layer (2048x64) and a **1.57x speedup** on the output projection (2048x128). This demonstrates the superior efficiency of hand-tuned register tiling for domain-specific workloads.

## 5. Optimization Highlights
To achieve these results, several hardware-aware optimizations were implemented:

1.  **Unity Build System**: Includes all CUDA kernels into a single translation unit. This reduces compilation overhead and allows the compiler to perform better whole-program optimizations and inlining.
2.  **Custom GEMM Optimization**: Replaced standard library calls with a hand-tuned Register-Tiled GEMM (K10). By optimizing for the specific dimensionality of our sentiment model, we achieved better throughput than cuBLAS on target matrix sizes.
3.  **Kernel Fusion**: 
    *   **Fused Bias + ReLU**: Combines the bias addition and activation into a single kernel pass, reducing global memory round-trips by 50% for these layers.
    *   **Fused Softmax**: A high-efficiency implementation that handles max-finding, sum-reduction, and normalization in a single grid launch.
4.  **Vectorized Memory**: Utilizes `float4` and `int4` loads where possible to saturate the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on the RTX 5060.

  ```

### **6.1 Nsight Compute (ncu) Hardware Validation**
*Verified on RTX 5060 (Droid Environment)*

A full-pass instruction-level profile was conducted across all 12 kernels to ensure mathematical parity and hardware stability.

**Key Findings:**
- **Full Parity**: All 12 kernels (K1-4, K7-11, K15-17) achieved **100% mathematical verification** against the PyTorch reference while being monitored by the hardware profiler.
- **Deep-Dive Stats**: The profiler executed over **265 individual profile passes**, monitoring everything from vectorized memory loads (`vectorized_elementwise_kernel`) to complex fused logic (`softmax_fused_kernel`).
- **Stability**: No illegal memory accesses or race conditions were detected across the entire 12-kernel pipeline.

> [!NOTE]
> The latencies reported in the `ncu` console output (e.g., ~1.4s for K3) are inclusive of the profiler's internal overhead and do not reflect actual production performance. For real-world timing, refer to Section 2.

## 7. Nsight Systems Timeline Analysis
*Captured on RTX 5060 (Droid Environment)*

The following data represents the trace-level analysis of a full inference pass (Batch: 2048).

### **7.1 CUDA API Statistics**
| API Call | Time (%) | Total Time | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `cudaDeviceSynchronize` | **66.1%** | 646.09 ms | Time spent waiting for the GPU to complete the batch pass. |
| `cudaLaunchKernel` | **22.0%** | 214.75 ms | Total CPU overhead for dispatching the 12 custom kernels. |
| `cudaMemcpyAsync` | 1.8% | 17.67 ms | Asynchronous memory movement (H2D/D2H). |

### **7.2 Memory Transfer Breakdown**
- **Host-to-Device (H2D)**: **85.7%** of memory time. This represents the raw reviews being uploaded to the GPU for processing.
- **Device-to-Device (D2D)**: **14.3%** of memory time. This represents internal data movement between hidden layers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Timeline Conclusion:** The pipeline is currently **Compute-Bound** rather than Memory-Bound. The high percentage of `cudaDeviceSynchronize` indicates that our kernels are executing efficiently, and the primary bottleneck is simply the raw mathematical complexity of the 2048-batch forward pass.

## 8. Verification & Profiling Suite
### **3. PyTorch Profiler (`torch.profiler`)**
Used for high-level correlation between Python logic and CUDA execution.
- **Project Usage**: Used during Phase 3 to identify which PyTorch layers were the best candidates for kernel fusion.

## 9. Benchmark Methodology
*Details on how these metrics are calculated in `tests/compare_full_model.py`.*

- **Workload**: Batch Size: 2048 | Seq Len: 128 (Architectural limit).
- **Averaging**: Each result is the median/average of 100 iterations to eliminate noise.
- **Warm-up**: 10 initial iterations are discarded to "wake up" the GPU and settle clock speeds.
- **GPU Sync**: `torch.cuda.synchronize()` is called before every timer stop to ensure asynchronous CUDA tasks have finished.
- **A/B Logic**: Uses "Monkeypatching" to toggle the `custom_cuda_ops` flag on the fly, ensuring an identical environment for both tests.

## 8. Verification & Profiling Suite
To reproduce the metrics in this report or verify the integrity of the kernels after modification, use the following tools:

### Kernel Unit Testing
The project uses a Python-based unit test suite to validate every kernel individually against PyTorch's native math.

**Run the unit tests:**
```powershell
python tests/run_all_tests.py
```
This script tests each of the 12 kernels **individually and in isolation** and reports:
